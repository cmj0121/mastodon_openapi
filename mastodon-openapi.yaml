  /api/v1_alpha/async_refreshes/{:id}:
    get:
      description: 'Sometimes an API request might not return the expected results
        or not all possible results as either a background job is already running
        to (re-)create these results or the request triggers a background job to create
        or fetch results.

        Examples of this are timelines that need to be re-created (which takes some
        time) and search or other requests that trigger fetching additional results
        from remote servers in the background.

        In all of these cases, the API response MAY include an additional header:

        The retry key includes a number of second the client SHOULD at least wait
        until retrying the same endpoint OR querying this one.

        The key result_count is optional. If present it includes a number of results
        that have already been fetched as part of this ongoing async refresh.

        Using the id, the client can query this endpoint here to get the current status
        of this async refresh.

        The status of an async refresh is either running or finished. For some async
        refreshes, like a timeline re-generation, this information is sufficient to
        decide to either wait some more or refresh the timeline. Other kinds of async
        refreshes may optionally include a key result_count that includes a number
        of new results already generated or fetched. Depending on this number, the
        client can decide to refetch the resource, wait some more, or do nothing.
        I.e. a finished job with a result_count of 0 means that the job has finished
        but yielded nothing new. Refreshing is not necessary in this case.

        Please note that the asynchronous nature of background jobs can lead to race
        conditions. Also the fact that some async refreshes might be user-agnostic
        while the fetched data is not, might mean that while new data is fetched,
        it will not be suitable for the current user. For example a background could
        be triggered to fetch new replies to a post. New replies could exist but the
        current usr might have blocked their authors.

        For those reasons the AsyncRefresh can only ever serve as an indicator of
        when it could be worthwile for a client to request new data. In the general
        case there is no guarantee that new data will be served.
